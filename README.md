# Kaggle Competition and MMD

This repo contains code written by me and Alessandro Rivello for a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection).

This is also part of our evaluation as students in the "Modelagem e Mineração de Dados" course, from the School of Applied of Mathematics at FGV, under the supervision of Professor [Renato Souza](https://github.com/rsouza).
